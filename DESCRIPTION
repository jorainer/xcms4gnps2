Description:
    xcms *for* GNPS2 provides an example workflow for preprocessing and
    preparation of an LC-MS/MS data set for feature-based molecular networking
    (FBMN) with GNPS2 on the example of a publicly available data set
    (MSV0000090156) from MassIVE. The workflow covers general visualization
    of LC-MS data and explains how data set-specific parameters for
    preprocessing with *xcms* can be derived.
